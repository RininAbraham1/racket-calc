12:41 am: First I would need to create a prefix-notation calculator in racket with two modes, one interactive and the other batch using the mode.rkt. I would need to build a recursive parser that processes the expressions left to right and keep the history. For the first session try the create the project structure and history.

12:51 am: I have set up the repository, now i need to start working on the calculator, The main problem will be trying to parse prefix notation and managing the history. Plan right now is to create main.rkt and set up the loop and history.
